First, we look at the number of students by occupation enrolled in the class, we see a large portion of the class are IT professionals. We also look at the average years of data visualization by occupation and in the details we see the average years of school is pretty consistent across occupations.

Next we look at the birth year of students, we see a majority born between 1980-1990. We also look at the gender breakdown, with >60% of students (2,253) being male.

This is quite a diverse class in terms of occupation, age, and gender. 

This course has helped me take a step back a re-evaluate both how I liik at information as well as how I present it. On multiple occassions I found myself deviating from how I would have previously presented information. The methods, explanations, and logic behind how to best present data were thought provoking. I think I will be better equipped to visualize data and present it to others in a meaningful way.
